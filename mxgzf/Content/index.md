## Hi, my name is **Maximilian Götzfried** (he/him)

## I'm a freelance software developer specialized in writing native apps for Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS) and helping existing teams dealing with complex code bases.

I have 5 years experience with Swift and 15+ years experience with Objective-C. I started building macOS apps in 2003 and worked with newer Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS) since they were introduced.

I am always happy to dive into complex challenges and write code that is easy to read, easy to test, and easy to delete.

### Are you available?

*Yes. I'm ready to talk about new projects.* Please contact me at [mail@mxgzf.com](mailto:mail@mxgzf.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliangoetzfried/) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Maximilian_Goetzfried2).

My hourly rate is 100 € plus 19 % tax. I'd be happy to offer you a fixed price if your project has a well-defined scope.

### Can you work on-site?

As a father of two kids (6 and 9 years old), *i prefer to work remotely*. But i can certainly manage to occasionally work on-site, even for multiple days or a whole week, especially around important deadlines.

I live in Gießen (Germany, GMT+1) which you can find on [Apple Maps](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Schöne Aussicht 22, 35396 Giessen, Germany&ll=50.608930,8.698648&q=Schöne Aussicht 22&_ext=EiYp+5kwQV5NSUAxeEshhBViIUA5eW9WnYROSUBB+Foy5FRpIUBQBA%3D%3D) or [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maximilian+Götzfried/@50.608959,8.698794,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47bc5f4c2cfa9f7f:0xec04a8a568cecc43). If you like, we can have our first meetup in my home office. I'd be happy to show you where i live and how i work.

Most of my previous clients were located in Germany and Switzerland, but i'd be happy to work world-wide. I speak English and German.

### What is your experience?

I shipped my first software in the late 90s. A software that hacks the binary of Internet Explorer for Mac to hide a specific UI element. Created with [ResEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) and published as freeware by a german magazine on  CD-ROM.

I started developing Mac apps in 2003. I first focused on developing layout software, written in Objective-C and based on Carbon and [ATSUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Type_Services_for_Unicode_Imaging). 

In 2006 i built [Liquifile](http://liquifile.info/), a file manager with a custom dynamic UI, which you can see in action in an [older video](http://liquifile.info/movie.htm). I was awarded by Apple for my work on this app with a Student Scholarship for the WWDC conference 2006 in San Francisco.

In 2010, i wrote two long articles for the first issue of "Mac Developer", a german magazine for Mac developers. I covered two topics: Mac OS X Snow Leopard and the newly introduced Grand Central Dispatch.

Starting in 2008, i built mostly iOS apps. Throughout the years i finished over 100 projects for my clients. Here are just a few examples:

- For CELLULAR AG (Hamburg), i built five news apps with fast scrolling feeds and a custom animated GIF engine, a dating app with a chat and a nutrition tracker app.
- I built a city performance tool for Promotion Software GmbH (Tübingen) that dynamically generates a financial and environment report (a 20-page-PDF with tabular data and charts).
- I also built a news app with SMS payment option for Voice Publishing AG (Zürich), an urban art guide for Neuland + Herzer (Frankfurt), a police app for kernpunkt GmbH (Köln), a dictionary app for Kaden Verlag (Heidelberg), a search app for telegate / 11880 AG and many more.

All my apps are native apps. I prefer writing code in Swift and Objective-C but i am familiar with C and C++, too. I also know how to write JavaScript for a `WKWebView`. 

I never stop learning new things. That's why i already have experiences with new frameworks like SwiftUI and Combine. I also follow the Swift community very closely. That's why i'm already familiar with recently released repositories like [apple/swift-argument-parser](apple/swift-argument-parser) and [icanzilb/TimelaneCombine](icanzilb/TimelaneCombine).

### Can you show me your code?

Sure. Most of my work is closed-source and under NDA but you can find some of my code online:

In 2015 i published a status bar app at [mxgzf/MXStatusMenu](https://github.com/mxgzf/MXStatusMenu) that i wrote with Swift 1.2 und Xcode 6.3. It was featured in an issue of the MacDevWeekly newsletter and listed on [uhub/awesome-swift](https://github.com/juan-sanzone-olx/awesome-swift-1).

You can also find my code on Stack Overflow: I helped fellow developers to deal with [asynchronous tasks and `DispatchGroup`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49763932/251839), [borderless `NSWindow`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49697684/251839), and [file search implementations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49764689/251839).

I recently rebuilt my website using Swift. Take a look at my blog post "[Relaunching my website using Swift](/posts/2020-03-03-Relaunching-my-website-using-Swift)" where i talk about my experiences and my code decisions. You can find the Swift package for my website on GitHub at [mxgzf/mxgzf.com](https://github.com/mxgzf/mxgzf.com) and the generated website at [mxgzf/mxgzf.github.io](https://github.com/mxgzf/mxgzf.github.io). 

You can find more of my code in [my other blog posts](#posts).
