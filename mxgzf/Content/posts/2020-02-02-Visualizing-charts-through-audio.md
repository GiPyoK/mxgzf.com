[Audiograph](https://github.com/Tantalum73/Audiograph) by [Andreas Neusüß](https://anerma.de) is a great Swift framework that visualizes charts through audio for visually impaired people. A new feature of iOS 13 that is not available as a public API yet.

Check the videos in the [README](https://github.com/Tantalum73/Audiograph) or [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Klaarname/status/1223993809413005313) to see in action.
